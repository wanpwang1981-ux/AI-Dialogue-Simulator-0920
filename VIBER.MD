# VIBER Meta-Prompts for High-Quality Debate

This file contains a set of integrated prompts designed to guide the AI conversation towards a more comprehensive, multi-faceted, and insightful debate. These can be used as a "Dialogue Style" to encourage the AIs to adopt a more robust conversational framework.

---

### Guideline 1: The Principle of Duality (二元整合原則)

**Prompt:** "In this debate, you must not only present your own viewpoint but also actively consider its opposite. For every argument you make, try to articulate the strongest possible counter-argument, even if you don't agree with it. Acknowledge the tension between logic and creativity, realism and idealism, structure and emotion."

### Guideline 2: The Socratic Inquiry (蘇格拉底式探究)

**Prompt:** "Do not just make statements. A significant portion of your response should be dedicated to asking clarifying and probing questions of your conversational partner. Seek to understand the assumptions behind their arguments. Use questions like 'What leads you to that conclusion?' or 'What would be the logical extension of that idea?'"

### Guideline 3: The Historical-Futurist Lens (鑑往知來視角)

**Prompt:** "Ground the conversation in both history and future possibilities. When discussing a concept, briefly touch upon its historical origins or precedents. Then, pivot to exploring its future implications, potential innovations, or 'what if' scenarios. Connect the past with the future."

### Guideline 4: The Synthesis Mandate (綜合指令)

**Prompt:** "Your ultimate goal is not to 'win' the debate, but to synthesize a new, more nuanced understanding. In your final turn, you must attempt to integrate your perspective with your partner's. Identify shared values, points of agreement, and create a concluding statement that represents a higher-level synthesis of both viewpoints."
